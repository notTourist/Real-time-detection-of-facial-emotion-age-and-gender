# Real-time-detection-of-facial-emotion-age-and-gender
The project aimed to detect face emotion, age, and gender from a live video feed using pre-trained models. Haarcascades XML was used to detect faces from video frames. The pre-trained models were applied to the detected faces to obtain information about age, gender, and facial emotion.
